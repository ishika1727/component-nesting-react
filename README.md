This is a small React code developed to see how concepts of component nesting and reusability work in React.js.

`Commentdetails.js` displays comments of users along with image and time. It is passed as a prop (props.children) in `Approvecard.js` which demonstrates component nesting. The image of the user is randomly generated using [`faker js`](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/). 

The UI is build using [semantic-ui.com](semantic-ui.com) framework.
